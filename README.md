Baby's first coding project, written in Python (3.11.5) with ~~*a little*~~ ***way*** too much help from GitHub Copilot. üòÖ
Aims to be a six-channel desktop loopback recorder with built-in sequencer. For making meme-y beats with whatever is playing on your desktop.

## **‚úÖCurrently working:** 
Loopback recording and playback on **Windows** to six channels in the GUI with per-channel volume control. Basically a soundboard.
*Note: currently working on **my** Windows desktop with a 13900k. Have noticed some playback issues on my laptop and am investigating.*

## **‚ùåCurrently working on:** 
Audio trimming with visible waveforms, real-time gain meters, effects processing, sequencer, UI improvements, general performance and reliability, Linux/Mac compatiblity.
