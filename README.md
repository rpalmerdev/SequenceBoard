# SequenceBoard

**((UNDER CONSTRUCTION))**

Baby's first coding project, written in Python (3.11.5) with ~~*a little*~~ ***way*** too much help from GitHub Copilot. 

Aims to be a six-channel desktop audio loopback recorder with built-in sequencer. For making meme-y beats with whatever is playing on your desktop.

**Currently working:** Loopback recording and playback on Windows to six channels in the GUI with basic per-channel volume control. Basically a soundboard.
*Note: currently working on **my** Windows desktop with a 13900k. Have noticed some playback issues on my laptop and am currently investigating.*

**Currently working on:** Audio trimming with visible waveforms, real-time gain meters, effects processing, sequencer, UI improvements, general performance and reliability.
