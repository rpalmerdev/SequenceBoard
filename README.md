# SequenceBoard

**((UNDER CONSTRUCTION))**

First time coding project, written in Python (3.11.5)

Aims to be a six-channel desktop audio loopback recorder with built-in sequencer. For making meme-y beats with whatever is playing on your desktop.

Uses a patched PyAudio library called [PyAudioWPatch](https://github.com/s0d3s/PyAudioWPatch/) for loopback functionality.
