# SequenceBoard

**((UNDER CONSTRUCTION))**

First time coding project, written in Python (3.11.5) with a *little* too much help from GitHub Copilot. 

Aims to be a six-channel desktop audio loopback recorder with built-in sequencer. For making meme-y beats with whatever is playing on your desktop.

**Currently working:** Loopback recording and playback on Windows to 6 channels in the GUI. Basically a soundboard currently.

**Currently working on:** Audio trimming with visible waveforms, real-time gain meters, effects processing, sequencer.
